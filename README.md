## How to setup Apache Kafka client and connect it to Amazon MSK cluster running in remote account using Private link (Multiple NLBs)
The code included in this repository and steps described below can be used 
to setup the PrivateLink Connectivity Pattern with Multiple NLBs to access an Amazon MSK Cluster
from a remote account. This pattern forms pattern 1 in the 
blog post - [How Goldman Sachs builds cross-account connectivity to their Amazon MSK clusters with AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-goldman-sachs-builds-cross-account-connectivity-to-their-amazon-msk-clusters-with-aws-privatelink/).

You will need access to two AWS accounts for this setup:
- Customer Account A: Account in which Amazon MSK Cluster will be setup.
- Customer Account B: Account in which Apache Kafka client will be setup.

The Java code identifies the ENIs and associated IP addresses corresponding to each of the Amazon MSK broker nodes in Account A, 
creates target groups with those IP addresses, creates NLBs in the same subnets for each of the target groups and listeners for each NLB and 
associates them with the NLBs. It then creates a VPC endpoint service for each of the NLBs. 
The code accepts a number of parameters, but the following are the important ones:
1.	mskClusterArn – This is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon MSK cluster in Account A
2.	region – This is the AWS Region where the code is running.
3.	allowedPrincipal – This is an important parameter and refers to the identity principal in Account B that has access to the endpoint service in Account A, and can be IAM users, IAM roles or AWS Accounts. For more information, see endpoint service permissions.
4.	lbListenerPort: This is the port the NLB listeners for each Amazon MSK broker will be listening on. For TLS connections, it should be 9094, and for PLAINTEXT, it should be 9092.
5.	targetPort: This is the port the target group associated with each NLB listener will be forwarding the request to the associated target, in this case, the IPv4 address of the Amazon MSK broker ENI.
      
The Java code also creates a DynamoDB table and updates it with information on the created endpoint services, 
including the broker id, the DNS name of the service endpoint, the NLB name, and the DNS name of the Amazon MSK broker endpoint. 
The purpose of the DynamoDB table and this information is to enable client accounts like Account B to be able to asynchronously and 
independently query the table, get the information, and use it to create the necessary resources on their side. 
Consequently, each client Account needs to be provided the requisite permissions on the DynamoDB table for the service endpoints it is interested in.

In Account B, you need to find out the Availability Zones (AZs) you need to use to create the VPC endpoints in, 
to access the service endpoints in Account A. This is because, AZs may not be the same across accounts. 
For example, us-east-1a in Account A may not be the same AZ as us-east-1a in Account B. So, it is important to find out 
the AZs in Account B that correspond to the same AZ ids in Account A and use them. 
The python script get-availabilityzones.py included in the GitHub repository allows you to do so. With the information at hand, 
you can create subnets in the appropriate AZs, and use them to create the VPC endpoints pointing to the service 
endpoints in Account A. Finally, you need to create a Route 53 private hosted zone and add resource record sets 
that alias the broker DNS endpoints to the VPC endpoints. The create-msk-vpc-endpoints-r53-hosted-zone.py and 
create-msk-vpc-endpoints.py scripts included in the GitHub repository help create those resources.

You can repeat the steps for Customer Account B for any number of accounts you want to add as consumer for Amazon MSK 
cluster running in Customer Account A.

Here are the steps to setup the cross-account access pattern for Amazon MSK with AWS PrivateLink:

### 1. Setup Amazon MSK Cluster in Account A
Note: Skip this step if you already have an Amazon MSK Cluster setup

In Account A, Deploy the CloudFormation template
    
    aws cloudformation deploy \
        --stack-name MSKCluster \
        --template-file cftemplates/MSKClusterWithVPC.yml \
        --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
 
   

### 2. Setup NLBs and Endpoint service in Account A

Package the jar file and run it to create the NLB, Target groups, VPC endpoint service for each NLB and Dynamo DB table with this information

    mvn package
    java -jar PrivateLinkCrossAccount-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
        --mskClusterArn <cluster_arn> --region <region_name> \
        --allowedPrincipal <role_arn> --targetPort <port_num> \
        --lbListenerPort <port_num>

    

   mskClusterArn is the ARN of you MSK cluster (required), 
   allowedPrincipal is the identity principal in Account B that has access to the endpoint service in Account A, and can be IAM users, IAM roles or AWS Accounts,
   region is the region your cluster is in (assumes us-east-1 if not provided), 
   targetPort is the port your MSK cluster Nodes are listening on (defaults to 9094), 
   lbListenerPort is the port that NLB listeners should listen on (defaults to 9094)

### 3. Setup role in Customer Account A to give read only access to Dynamo DB table created in above step to user in Customer Account B 

    python createBrokerEndpointsDDBReadOnyRole.py --profile <cluster_account_profile_name> \
        --arn <user_arn>

### 4. In Customer Account B, Get Availability zone information of the Broker nodes for Amazon MSK Cluster

    python remoteaccountpython/get-availabilityzones.py --region <region_name> \
        --profile <client_account_profile_name> \ 
        --roleArn <roleARN_from_previous_command>


   Note: This command is to be run with AWS CLI profile for Customer Account B
   Here roleARN is the ARN received after running previous command
   This will output the availability zones in which Customer Account A MSK Cluster has the Broker Nodes. Note that because you are running this using the Customer B account profile, the availability zone Names will map to same availability zone IDs and hence can be used directly to setup subnets for Apache kafka clients

### 5. Setup Apache Kafka Client instance in Customer Account B

In Account B:

   1. Deploy the CloudFormation template to setup VPC that will host the Apache Kafka Client

        ```shell
        aws cloudformation deploy \
            --stack-name MSKClientVPC \
            --template-file cftemplates/MSKVPC.yml \
            --parameter-overridesPublicSubnet1AZ=<AZ1_name> PrivateSubnet1AZ=<AZ1_name> PrivateSubnet2AZ=<AZ2_name> PrivateSubnet3AZ=<AZ3_name> \
            --profile <mskclient_profile_name>
        ```
    
   Here Parameter value for AZ names is the output from previous command. Note than the cloud formation template will not fail but create subnet in random AZs if these params are not passed. However, for the Apache Kafka client instance to be able to talk to the remote Amazon MSK cluster via all of the Endpoints setup in cluster account, it is important to pass these params.

   2. Deploy the CloudFormation template to setup the Apache Kafka Client instance

        ```shell
        aws cloudformation deploy \
            --stack-name MSKClient \
            --template-file cftemplates/MSKBastionKafkaClientInstance.yml \
            --parameter-overrides  KeyName=<ec2_keypair> \
            --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --profile <mskclient_profile_name>
        ```

   3. Create a Route53 private hosted Zone in client account.

        ```shell
        python remoteaccountpython/create-msk-vpc-endpoints-r53-hosted-zone.py --region <region_name> --stackName MSKClient --profile <mskclient_profile_name>
        ```

   4. Create VPC Endpoints in client account and Resource RecordSets of type ‘A’ for each broker dns name - Alias pointing to the VPC Endpoint so that requests for each broker dns endpoints are directed to the associated endpoint.
        
        ```shell
        python remoteaccountpython/create-msk-vpc-endpoints.py --region <region_name> \
            --roleArn <roleARN_from_step_3> --stackName MSKClient \
            --profile <mskclient_profile_name>
        ```
 
Note: the setup process for this pattern can be fully automated to make sure even if Amazon MSK cluster is scaled out (e.g. adding more brokers), the appropriate resources are created in both the cluster and client accounts to make sure the solution continues to work as expected. 
 - A lambda function continuously monitors the MSK cluster for any change.
 - If a new broker is added to the MSK cluster, lambda function creates the required NLB and endpoint services. It also updates a DynamoDB table with the new changes
 - A lambda function is setup in client account which listen to the DynamoDB table stream
in cluster account. If a new record is added to the DynamoDB, the lambda function creates the required endpoint interface and make the required changes into Routh53 hosted zone and record set.
